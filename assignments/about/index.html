        Hi, my name is Lyndol Cromartie, and this is my website.
        I am new to web development, this is the first time I have 
        ever done anything like this. I have to admit, coming into 
        the world of computer science was and sometimes continues to be 
        very intimidating. I've only begun my studies this year, starting
        with SQL Server, Database Theory and a few other communication classes.
        Although I am not quite sure what path I want to take, in terms of
        becoming a developer or buisness analyst, I do know that I have a tremendous
        interest in the coding.</p>

          <p>Discovering some of the things one can do gives way to wonder what could
          be done in the future. The world has changed so much since I was a kid.
          I consider myself very fortunate because I grew up at a time much different 
          from today. I witnessed the transition to the mostly technilogical driven world
          that we presently live in. Ive recently discovered I am considered a <b>"millennial"</b>,
          and you know what? I'm ok with that. Just saying it makes me feel younger already.
          I've heard a lot said about millennials, and I think it's a fair assesment to say that
          we see the world different from the generations before.</p>

          <p>Having grew up in a time before smart phones, computers, and tablets I can 
              appreciate the traditions of the past while embracing some of the changes of 
            today by excepting the challenges to make a better tomorrow. I know that sounds very 
        confusing and I apologize, If your reading this you may want to go back to that last sentence 
    and read it a few more times to really undertand what I mean, even though I wrote it, I had to review 
it again myself to make sure it read right. There is no other way I could think of to say it. </p></figure>
