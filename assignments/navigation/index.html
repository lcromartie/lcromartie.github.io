<main>
 <section>
      <h1 id="task">Task</h1>
        <p>Task, to learn and understand how to create and use the navigation element by writing HTML code.
            <br>
            This is the page section labeled <strong>'task'</strong>.
            <br>
             In the navigation list, when i click on the word navigation, 
            this is where the browser window will direct the view back to.
            <br> 
            The idea is structure the page so that 
            each section takes up enough space for the explorer window to have a scroll bar on its side or located
             at the bottom of the page.
             <br>
              I am simply adding a bunch of meaningless text to fill in the gap sort of speak. <br>

             I wasnt sure where we got the text from in class when we initially began this assingment, but hopefully this will suffice.          
        </p>
      <input types= "text" name="list-data" id="list-data">
      <button id= "set-text" type= "button">Set Text</button>
      <button id= "add-to-list" type= "button"> Add to list</button>
     <ul id="my-list"></ul>
    
     <h1 id ="condition">Condition</h1>
       <p>The conditions are as follows, given a highly motivated individual
           with no prior experience in Web Development.
           <br>
            Provided software and instruction
           as well as examples, located in a both a class room setting and home office.
           <br>
           To complete assignment according to instructions given and on time,
           set to be no later than the date of 28 October 2018.

  </section>

  <section>
      <h2 id="standard">Standard</h2>
        <p>The standard is to create navigation element, which will 
            allow the browser window to navigate directly to the section 
            labeled in the navigation section of the page using the 
            <b>nav</b> tag.
            <br>
             Create and properly label at-least 3 functioning <b>nav</b>
            tags within the main section of the html file.
            <br>
             Add a CSS file with optional 
            styling. Turn in assignment no later than 28 October 2018.
