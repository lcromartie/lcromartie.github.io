        <h1>Champion</h1>

        <p>The word "champion" is defined as a person who has defeated or surpassed all rivals in competition, synonymous with winner.
            Studying the field of information systems and technology presents quite a challenge. 
        I dont intend to be a quitter or give up, rather come out the other side of this a champion.</p>
